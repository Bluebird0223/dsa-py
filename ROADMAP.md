## 💡 Study Tips

1. **Consistency > Intensity**: 2 hours daily is better than 14 hours on Sunday
2. **Active Recall**: Close the solution and try to implement from memory
3. **Spaced Repetition**: Revisit problems after 1 day, 1 week, 1 month
4. **Teach Others**: Explain solutions to solidify understanding
5. **Track Mistakes**: Maintain an error journal

## 🎯 Customizing Your Pace

- **Fast Track (9 weeks)**: 15-20 hours/week
- **Standard (13 weeks)**: 10-15 hours/week  
- **Relaxed (20 weeks)**: 6-8 hours/week

**Remember**: This is a marathon, not a sprint. Focus on understanding, not just completion!
