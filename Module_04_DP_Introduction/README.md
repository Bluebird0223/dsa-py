# Module 4: Dynamic Programming - Introduction

## 🎯 Welcome to Dynamic Programming!

This is where the **MAIN** focus of the course begins! Dynamic Programming is one of the most powerful algorithmic techniques and highly valued in technical interviews.

## What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic Programming (DP) is an optimization technique that:
1. **Breaks down complex problems** into simpler subproblems
2. **Stores solutions** to avoid recomputing them
3. **Builds up solutions** from smaller to larger problems

**Key Insight**: DP turns exponential O(2ⁿ) algorithms into polynomial O(n) or O(n²)!

> [!TIP]
> DP has a reputation for being difficult, but it's just a pattern! Once you recognize the pattern, it becomes mechanical.
